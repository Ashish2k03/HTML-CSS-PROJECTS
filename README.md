# HTML-CSS-PROJECTS
This repository contains a collection of web development projects built only using HTML and CSS. Each project is organized into its own folder and showcases different techniques and layouts as I practice front-end development. Live project links are provided for the projects I worked on, so donâ€™t forget to check the README files!
